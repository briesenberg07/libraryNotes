### 20180702
#### To-do / ideas for this week
- Continue writing HTML triples:
- schema.org RDFa
- schema.org microdata
[x] Microdata vs. RDFa for schema.org properties?
       Neither, JSON in HTML <head> element
- More testing with Google Structured Data Testing Tool: Different results with RDFa vs. microdata?
[x] Other schema.org validators/resources?
       See Zotero CaMS resources
[x] Reading--what syntax is recommended for best results and visibility?
[x] Set up Fuseki on laptop on the UW network
- ... (review meeting agenda/notes from Friday, etc.)
### 20180703
Switching gears, based on conversation with Theo yesterday (see notes), I will focus on putting schema.org properties NOT in RDFa or microdata in the HTML, BUT RATHER in JSON in the HTML <head>.  
Started on editing HTML page text  
SourceResource_HTMLText  
Started work on JSON-LD script for HTML files: Experiment2_Atom.json  
#### JSON ISSUES/To-Do/Notes:
schema identifier property:
From hcl_sourceResource-metadata-dc.xml:
   `<identifier identifierType="DOI">10.6069/uwlib.55.A.2.1</identifier>`
NOTE: Currently just using the @id keyword
"@id": "https://doi.org/10.6069/uwlib.55.A.2.1"
Add identifier with type DOI here? Is it worth it? Does this offer any SEO benefits or just make things look fancier?
How to type and add sub-properties? How to use URL datatype? Or should I use other subproperties, etc?
Using the identifier property with value and type MAY be proper JSON-LD, but DOI type values are not recognized by Google. Or it could just be incorrect JSON-LD:
```
"identifier": {
         "@value": "10.6069/uwlib.55.A.2.1",
         "@type": "info:doi/"
},
```
From hcl_sourceResource-metadata-dc.xml:
   ``<language>en-US</language>``
- Language:
  - value for the inLanguage property: Is just "English" actually okay? Or do we need a type, additional properties, etc.?
  - Do we need to make any language specifications for dataset name, alternate name, description, etc.?
- NOTES:
  - Values for name (and potentially other properties) may need to change depending on edits to the HTML description of the data and dataset titles, etc., therein.
creator and publisher:
  - Values for these properties have types and additional properties. There are good opportunities to add properties for things like contact information, etc. for UW Libraries.
  - Google does NOT recognize the pending structured data properties from schema (sdPublisher, etc.)
  - Confirming--ISO 8601 is specified for type Date by schema.org; okay to only include year?
  - XML Datacite metadata specifies "LibraryData" as a subtype of Dataset. Can we do this in JSON-LD as well:
   `<resourceType resourceTypeGeneral="Dataset">LibraryData</resourceType>`
- I've preserved the element order from Datacite XML file except for the type "Dataset" which I put at the top
- Would schemaVersion property be useful? (This might not be used by Google, etc.)
- The fileSize property is not recognized by Google for the object type Dataset
### 20180705
#### More JSON draft notes
- For future: Do we need a transform to convert Datacite XML metadata files to JSON-LD scripts for HTML headers?
- encodingFormat property:
`"encodingFormat": "XHTML+RDFa 1.1"`
vs.
`"encodingFormat": ["application/xhtml", "application/RDFa 1.1"]`
vs.
`"encodingFormat": ["text/xhtml", "text/RDFa"]`
vs. something else?

### 20180706
#### Cleaning exported CONTENTdm metadata
- See:
  - [aypDataCleaning](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Mb1C7xfAPkEG980RNlEbBgIw9ow4-IXo21k8f1SQ9MU/edit?usp=sharing)
  - [aypMetadataNotes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bI6pf8SceygexT_ozEdFmEG6RoGjY5aI7cCs8KyPXLo/edit?usp=sharing)
  - ayp_2018_07_05.xml(https://drive.google.com/file/d/1l6Rw9vqaDCbNCcDbhIYq2OKxDHUWE5-e/view?usp=drive_web)

  - I'm seeing the same issues as with HCL exports involving character entity references
  - The main offender seems to be $amp coming through in exports where metadata text strings included an ampersand. This also seems to sometimes prematurely close elements, with the text following the ampersand appearing in another repeated element. See:
  ```
  <SubjectsLcsh>Simonds Manufacturing Company--Exhibits &amp</SubjectsLcsh>
  <SubjectsLcsh>amp</SubjectsLcsh>
  <SubjectsLcsh>displays</SubjectsLcsh>
  ```
  Also,
  - < should be &lt; but is coming through as &amp;lt;
  - \> should be &gt; but is coming through as &amp;gt;
    - The above usually (always) come before and after (respectively) "br" to create a line break in displayed metadata
  To solve this I did the following:
  - replace &amp;lt;br with &lt;br
  - replace br&amp;gt; with br&gt;
    - 44 instances of each were replaced in my 10-item subset
  **RE: Data cleaning with OpenRefine**  
  - I still have not been able to open any CONTENTdm exports in OpenRefine. I need to test whether they can be opened after cleaning with Oxygen, if the issue is the fact that exported XML is not well-formed
  **Working on XSL_02 / NOTES:**  
  - I'm using TBD for components of DOIs that will need to be finalized later.
### 20180709
#### XSL for Alaska Yukon Pacific
- How to generate blank node ids?
- How to accurately refer to previously generated blank node ids?
   - Creating agent file, so this is put off for now
- Data cleaning:
   - Look at XML exports with controlled vocabulary off--any different?
   - Begin work cleaning entire AYP export
   - Document actions
- Follow up on JSON for HTML head
- Follow up on edits to landing-page text
   - Putting off until later
