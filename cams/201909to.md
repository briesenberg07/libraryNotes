#### Sinopia stuff:
[This issue](https://github.com/LD4P/sinopia_editor/issues/1153#) is helping me understand a lot of stuff:

> The URI is minted when you click Save & Publish. A URI is minted only for the main resource described by the template. For example if you have a template with resource class = Work, then we mint a URI for the Work. If you template nests an Instance template, we don't mint a URI for that nested Instance.

> Yes, currently Sinopia creates blank node for nested RTs. De-nesting would be a good idea for many reasons!

**So nested RTs don't get IRIs**
