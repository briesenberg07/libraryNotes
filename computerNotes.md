  - I just uninstalled Ubuntu on my machine and I'm going to reinstall because I saw this:
  > Once the setup step is complete, Ubuntu will asks you for a Username and password, and you have two choices:  
    > - close it (if you want to be root by default)  
    > - fill it out (if you don't want to be root by default)  
  > Whichever you choose is up to you, and the only real things this affects (since this is your own computer and not a shared system) is what your $HOME directory will be named and whether or not you have to type su[do] for some commands.  
 > I, personally, use the first method (I think I just gave a sysadmin an aneurysm somewhere).
