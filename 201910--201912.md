#### [When I grow up, I want to be a Linked Data librarian - what you should learn first](https://youtu.be/8kLts4VBIHU)
- Who knew that there was such a thing as [Linked Data for Professional Education (LD4PE)](http://explore.dublincore.net/)?
 - This includes an index of competencies
- This presentation is a look at job-posting requirements for "linked-data librarians"

#### Sinopia User Group meeting
Search is case-insensitive
Search will match diacritics even when input is without
Default is now AND instead of OR for searches with multiple words
Can Search using a URI
	(But search will fail if no title)
Upgraded framework that controls how UI looks:
	"Things are more lined up"
	Fixes jumping around, moving from one column to the other
You can't open an RT that references an RT that is not present in Sinopia
	Note that error message will be at top of table, though
Discussion of putting lookup sources in an order
  "Ability to specify order of multiple lookup sources in a field"
Lots of discussion about the possibility of deleting profiles
  But what about the fact that there are no access restrictions?
#### More git stuff
Used the following to overwrite everything on my local disk with contents from the remote repo:
```
git fetch --all
[then]
git reset --hard origin/master
```
I'll be honest about the fact that I don't really understand *how* this worked but only *that* it worked.
I also used this to sync my clone of the UW schemasProject, substituting `origin` with `upstream`.

Storing git credentials from the terminal  
Using [EXAMPLES](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-credential-store#_examples) from git documentation, git-credential-store - Helper to store credentials on disk  
```
$ git config credential.helper store
$ git push http://example.com/repo.git
Username: <type your username>
Password: <type your password>
[several days later]
$ git push http://example.com/repo.git
[your credentials are used automatically]
```
*Note that I used the above exactly and it worked*

**TODAY STUFF**  
- My to dos are all over the place. I don't really like Microsoft To Do at all. I currently have to-dos there, in Asana, in GitHub issues ([UWLibCatProfiles](https://github.com/CECSpecialistI/UWLibCatProfiles/issues)), in Outlook (flagged emails), here in these notes...
- [ ] Email Aimee in ITS about a new computer
- [ ] Email Brad Van Horne to see about a surplus lamp
- [ ] Follow up on the many comments in the [Draft Supplement to RDA...](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SD6UdVE2PSIZ753FmZdhr4x6HQRrX6CUueZjMXQ7cDU/edit?usp=sharing)
  - Especially, if Theo made changes to the RDF file, where is the new file? Has it already been published?
- [ ] Review [SinopiaCataloging](https://sites.google.com/uw.edu/sinopiacataloging/contact)  
**To Try** from Theo  
Cool way to retrieve a “record” from Sinopia:  
Say we want to retrieve the work identified by https://trellis.development.sinopia.io/repository/washington/9c5bd9f5-1804-45bd-99ed-b6e3774c896e  
- Open a  \*nix shell; bash shell works.
- Store the URI in a variable: `sinUri=https://trellis.development.sinopia.io/repository/washington/9c5bd9f5-1804-45bd-99ed-b6e3774c896e`
- Curl the record; Sinopia, or Trellis, returns Turtle by default so no http “accept” statement is needed in the header.
- Then pipe it to sed replacing the <> with the URI stored in a var: `curl -G $sinUri | sed "s|<>|$sinUri|g"`  
*Try it!*  
- If you want to see just the default turtle, then enter the command before the pipe to sed: `curl -G $sinUri`  
*Or:*  
- `curl -G https://trellis.development.sinopia.io/repository/washington/9c5bd9f5-1804-45bd-99ed-b6e3774c896e`
- You can see that we don't have the URI -- but at the same time we know the URI.
- The end.
- Wait! I made an error: there should be angle brackets around the variable `$sinUri` in the sed substitution!
