### 20191104 -- THIS WEEK
### 20191105
#### Install Connexion
- [OCLC Connexion Client Installation](https://staff.lib.uw.edu/operations/cams/policies-procedures/oclc-setup-and-procedures/oclc-connexion-client-installation)
- Seems good except I'm not sure about this:
> Open any bib record and look at the ALA character set. If the window is blank, restart your PC and then the ALA character set should be viewable.  

#### Still to do before Tuesday 12 November (1st training session)
- [OCLC Connexion Export to Alma](https://staff.lib.uw.edu/portals/ex-libris/management/oclc-connexion-export-to-alma)
- Reading:
 - [Alma Inventory (Creating Holdings, Items, and Portfolios)](https://staff.lib.uw.edu/operations/cams/policies-procedures/general-cataloging-procedures-and-resources/alma-inventory)
  - Mostly focus on holdings and items, but good to know a bit about portfolios
 - [Alma Work Orders](https://staff.lib.uw.edu/operations/cams/policies-procedures/general-cataloging-procedures-and-resources/alma-work-orders)
 - [Alma Overlay](https://staff.lib.uw.edu/operations/cams/policies-procedures/general-cataloging-procedures-and-resources/alma-overlay)

#### Wikidata Affinity Group Call
##### [Zoom connection](https://stanford.zoom.us/j/204437188)
##### [Meeting Notes]( https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e09HBXcLQxGJggEjGiaurZPLt9V4DKA5jLbb9bmbFuA/edit?usp=sharing)
- **Martin Poulter**
 - Just finished residency at University of Oxford
- **Using Wikidata to describe the structure of a book**
 - Wikidata generally just tries to capture the "top two levels of FRBR: Works and their editions/translations"
 - [w.wiki/BQG](https://w.wiki/BQG): *Sample query - Check it out*
 - (Review of notability: Anything that has a page on any Wiki* platform?)
 - Brief description of Wikisource
  - One current project is working with scans and fixing the OCR
  - This is something that I want to get involved with
  - Less stressful than Wikipedia (paraphrase); "just deciding what text is visible on page"
  - Projects with a traffic-light system: red to green, blue = problematic/complicated
  - Producing definitive electronic version of book! Sections, etc., can be bookmarked!
  - Wikisource makes use of Wikidata in a number of ways! For example, Wikisource author profile pages draw from Wikidata
  - Dictionary of National Biography (DNB) is the biggest (?) English-language accomplishment in Wikisource
  - [w.wiki/BQf](https://w.wiki/BQf): *Another sample query*
  - Wikisource really likes **biographical dictionaries**
  - The electronic edition projects also involve marking up the text!
   - Curious about this markup? Like TEI?
  - Using Google sheets to create data which is then fed into "Quick Statements" and becomes WD items/statements??
  - "it's joining up different facts to make a web that is the attraction of Wikidata"
  - [w.wiki/BQN](https://w.wiki/BQN): *Sample TIMELINE query (!?!?)*
  - **Questions:**
   - Wikisource doesn't go all the way to TEI, but a Wikisource corrected transcription can play a part in the process--corrects transcription, can be exported as XML, etc.
   - Wikisource transcription work can focus more of formatting, matching appearance of scanned page, etc., than some researchers are interested in.

### 20191101
#### QA Study Hall
- Wikidata QA will be available in Sinopia soon!
- New functionality coming: From lookup UI, link out to result resources in their full informational context!
- Important to differentiate in lookup URNs: For an agent search, for example, don't use LoC all names, use LCNAF or other names sub-authority, etc.
- Some scripts/diacritics are working (matching with results) in QA lookups and some aren't

![20191025112600762_page_0002](https://github.com/briesenberg07/libraryNotes/blob/master/images/20191025112600762_page_0002.jpg)
#### More to-dos and meetings
Wikipedia Edit-a-Thon meeting, SHACL group meeting  
![20191025112600762_page_0003](https://github.com/briesenberg07/libraryNotes/blob/master/images/20191025112600762_page_0003.jpg)
### 20191023
#### [When I grow up, I want to be a Linked Data librarian - what you should learn first](https://youtu.be/8kLts4VBIHU)
- Who knew that there was such a thing as [Linked Data for Professional Education (LD4PE)](http://explore.dublincore.net/)?
 - This includes an index of competencies
- This presentation is a look at job-posting requirements for "linked-data librarians"
#### CaMS Department meeting
![20191025112600762_page_0001](https://github.com/briesenberg07/libraryNotes/blob/master/images/20191025112600762_page_0001.jpg)
### 20191021
#### Sinopia User Group meeting
- Search is case-insensitive  
- Search will match diacritics even when input is without  
- Default is now AND instead of OR for searches with multiple words  
- Can Search using a URI  
	- (But search will fail if no title)  
- Upgraded framework that controls how UI looks:  
	- "Things are more lined up"  
	- Fixes jumping around, moving from one column to the other  
- You can't open an RT that references an RT that is not present in Sinopia  
	- Note that error message will be at top of table, though  
- Discussion of putting lookup sources in an order  
  - "Ability to specify order of multiple lookup sources in a field"  
- Lots of discussion about the possibility of deleting profiles  
  - But what about the fact that there are no access restrictions?  
#### More git stuff
Used the following to overwrite everything on my local disk with contents from the remote repo:
```
git fetch --all
[then]
git reset --hard origin/master
```
I'll be honest about the fact that I don't really understand *how* this worked but only *that* it worked.
I also used this to sync my clone of the UW schemasProject, substituting `origin` with `upstream`.

### 20191018
Storing git credentials from the terminal  
Using [EXAMPLES](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-credential-store#_examples) from git documentation, git-credential-store - Helper to store credentials on disk  
```
$ git config credential.helper store
$ git push http://example.com/repo.git
Username: <type your username>
Password: <type your password>
[several days later]
$ git push http://example.com/repo.git
[your credentials are used automatically]
```
*Note that I used the above exactly and it worked*
### 20191016
**TODAY STUFF**  
- My to dos are all over the place. I don't really like Microsoft To Do at all. I currently have to-dos there, in Asana, in GitHub issues ([UWLibCatProfiles](https://github.com/CECSpecialistI/UWLibCatProfiles/issues)), in Outlook (flagged emails), here in these notes...
- [ ] Email Aimee in ITS about a new computer
- [ ] Email Brad Van Horne to see about a surplus lamp
- [ ] Follow up on the many comments in the [Draft Supplement to RDA...](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SD6UdVE2PSIZ753FmZdhr4x6HQRrX6CUueZjMXQ7cDU/edit?usp=sharing)
  - Especially, if Theo made changes to the RDF file, where is the new file? Has it already been published?
- [ ] Review [SinopiaCataloging](https://sites.google.com/uw.edu/sinopiacataloging/contact)  
**To Try** from Theo  
Cool way to retrieve a “record” from Sinopia:  
Say we want to retrieve the work identified by https://trellis.development.sinopia.io/repository/washington/9c5bd9f5-1804-45bd-99ed-b6e3774c896e  
- Open a  \*nix shell; bash shell works.
- Store the URI in a variable: `sinUri=https://trellis.development.sinopia.io/repository/washington/9c5bd9f5-1804-45bd-99ed-b6e3774c896e`
- Curl the record; Sinopia, or Trellis, returns Turtle by default so no http “accept” statement is needed in the header.
- Then pipe it to sed replacing the <> with the URI stored in a var: `curl -G $sinUri | sed "s|<>|$sinUri|g"`  
*Try it!*  
- If you want to see just the default turtle, then enter the command before the pipe to sed: `curl -G $sinUri`  
*Or:*  
- `curl -G https://trellis.development.sinopia.io/repository/washington/9c5bd9f5-1804-45bd-99ed-b6e3774c896e`
- You can see that we don't have the URI -- but at the same time we know the URI.
- The end.
- Wait! I made an error: there should be angle brackets around the variable `$sinUri` in the sed substitution!
