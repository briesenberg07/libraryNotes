**TO-DOs this week**

#### Alma data review plan
Theo will work with what is in [CenterCell](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FKOWdrRRrom9ZtLcZwAzMhaCvASzdvtvSxQm6TuvHco/edit?usp=sharing). He will get in touch with me as more info is required. I'm not going to work more on the Alma data-review write up at this point.

#### Sinopia stuff:
[This issue](https://github.com/LD4P/sinopia_editor/issues/1153#) is helping me understand a lot of stuff:

> The URI is minted when you click Save & Publish. A URI is minted only for the main resource described by the template. For example if you have a template with resource class = Work, then we mint a URI for the Work. If you template nests an Instance template, we don't mint a URI for that nested Instance.

> Yes, currently Sinopia creates blank node for nested RTs. De-nesting would be a good idea for many reasons!

**So nested RTs don't get IRIs**

**TO DO**
- [ ] ~~Alma data review~~
- [X] Look @ [Wunderlist](https://www.wunderlist.com/#/lists/all)
- [X] Emails
- [X] Remove "for" from concatenation for RT titles
- [X] Tag Theo in [commit where I deleted old XSLTs](https://github.com/CECSpecialistI/UWLibCatProfiles/commit/99e06f2d2bc4e99b0e6e535101b9189abc9a70ce)
- [X] Look at [Draft Supplement to RDA RDF Ontology](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SD6UdVE2PSIZ753FmZdhr4x6HQRrX6CUueZjMXQ7cDU/edit?usp=sharing): Are upward-chaining properties available in the [RDA Registry](https://www.rdaregistry.info)? Etc.  

I signed up for [Library Carpentry](https://rochellelundy.github.io/2019-09-24-UWSeattle/) on Sept. 24!  
If I switch to Linux prior I can change my sign-up responses [here](https://docs.google.com/forms/u/1/d/e/1FAIpQLSdITUUxQInLDHmLQpauYhM_wPocntsz99rSm2crjha7b-Npdg/viewform?usp=form_confirm&edit2=2_ABaOnudBki_KNLjrqmgNXENju9duLSWSO_D0EeI4WQUPM7F3ZxNAQQZ1035J4X_wU4ZsKd4).
